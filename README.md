# Haskell Undefined Value Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: using an undefined value in a calculation.  The `undefined` value represents a computation that hasn't been given a value, leading to a runtime exception.  The solution shows how to handle potential undefined values using pattern matching or the Maybe monad.
